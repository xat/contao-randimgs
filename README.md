# contao-randimgs

Modul for displaying some random images in the Contao frontend.
The difference to the buildin "Random Image" Modul is that this modul walks through a folder rekursivly and is not limited to one image.
This means you could use it to build a slider or something filled with random images.

There is HOOK which enables you to influence the folder in which this modul should look for images.

Please notice that this modul is currently limited to only one lookup folder and does only work with Contao 2.11.x.
